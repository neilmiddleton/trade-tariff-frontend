    <p>
      The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be
      considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of
      Article 5 of this Annex.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="Note 2:">Note 2:</h3>

    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
      <li>
        <p>
          The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained.
          The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in
          the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of
          goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry
          in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3 or 4.
          Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by
          an “ex”, this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to
          the part of that heading as described in column 2.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a
          chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2
          is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3
          or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are
          classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings
          grouped together in column 1.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Where there are different rules in the list applying to different
          products within a heading, each indent contains the description of
          that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3
          or 4.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in
          both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to
          apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4.
          If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3
          is to be applied.

    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
      <li>
        <p>
          The provisions of Article 5 of this Annex, concerning products having
          acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other
          products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been
          acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in
          another factory in the Community or in Chile.
        </p>

        <p>Example:</p>

        <p>
          An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value
          of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not
          exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from “other alloy steel
          roughly shaped by forging” of heading ex 7224.
        </p>

        <p>
          If this forging has been forged in the Community from a
          non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by
          virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list. The forging can
          then count as originating in the value-calculation for the engine,
          regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in
          another factory in the Community. The value of the non-originating
          ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the
          non-originating materials used.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or
          processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or
          processing also confers originating status; conversely, the
          carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating
          status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a
          certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material
          at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such
          material at a later stage is not.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression
          “Manufacture from materials of any heading”, then materials of any
          heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the
          product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations
          which may also be contained in the rule.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, the expression “Manufacture from materials of any heading,
          including other materials of heading ...” or “Manufacture from
          materials of any heading, including other materials of the same
          heading as the product” means that materials of any heading(s) may be
          used, except those of the same description as the product as given in
          column 2 of the list.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured
          from more than one material, this means that one or more materials
          may be used. It does not require that all be used.
        </p>

        <p>Example:</p>

        <p>
          The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural
          fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials,
          may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is
          possible to use one or the other, or both.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured
          from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent
          the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature,
          cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to
          textiles).
        </p>

        <p>Example:</p>

        <p>
          The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically
          excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent
          the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not
          products from cereals.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot
          be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list,
          can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier
          stage of manufacture.
        </p>

        <p>Example:</p>

        <p>
          In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from
          non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is
          allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from
          non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made
          from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at
          the stage before yarn - that is, the fibre stage.
          </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the
          maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then
          these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the
          maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never
          exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the
          individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the
          particular materials to which they apply.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
      <li>
        <p>
          The term “natural fibres” is used in the list to refer to fibres other
          than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages
          before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise
          specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or
          otherwise processed, but not spun.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The term “natural fibres” includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of
          headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse
          animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201
          to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The terms “textile pulp”, “chemical materials” and “paper-making
          materials” are used in the list to describe the materials, not
          classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture
          artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The term “man-made staple fibres” is used in the list to refer to
          synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of
          headings 5501 to 5507.
        </p>

            products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip
            consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film
            whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not
            exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured
            adhesive between two layers of plastic film,
          </li>
          <li>
            other products of heading 5605.
            <br>
            Example:
            <br>
            A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203
            and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn.
            Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not
            satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical
            materials or textile pulp) may be used, provided that their total
            weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn.
            <br>
            Example:
            <br>
            A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading
            5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed
            fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the
            origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or
            textile pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the
            origin-rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not
            carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning), or a
            combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total
            weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.
            <br>
            Example:
            <br>
            Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of
            heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is a only mixed
            product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from
            yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns
            used are themselves mixtures.
            <br>
            Example:
            <br>
            If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton
            yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then,
            obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials
            and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.

      <li>
        <p>
          In the case of products incorporating “yarn made of polyurethane
          segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped”,
          this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.
        </p>

          (with the exception of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy
          the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product

        <p>Example:</p>

        <p>
          If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item
          (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use
          of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified
          within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent
          the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally
          contain textiles.

          For the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902
          and ex 3403, simple operations, such as cleaning, decanting,
          desalting, water-separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining
          a sulphur-content as a result of mixing products with different
          sulphur-contents, or any combination of these operations or like
          operations, do not confer origin.

          Redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process means
          distillation (other than topping) by a continuous or batch process
          employed in industrial installations using distillates of subheading
          Nos 2710 11 to 2710 99, 2711 11, 2711 12 to 2711 19, 2711 21 and 2711

          only those process by means of which at least three different products
          are obtained are admissible, but this restriction does not apply in
          any instance where the process consists in the separation of isomers.
          In so far this concerns xylenes, ethylbenzene is included with xylene
