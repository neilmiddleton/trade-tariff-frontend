      quotas_information_html: |
        <p>
          Quotas allow a limited amount of goods to be imported at a lower duty
          rate. Once the quota has been used up, you will revert to the out-of-quota
          rate, which may be the third-country duty or a preferential rate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Quotas can be non-preferential (open to many countries) or preferential
          (restricted to a particular trading partner).
