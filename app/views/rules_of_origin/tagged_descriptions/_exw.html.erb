<b>Ex-works price</b><br>
When importing on Ex Works terms, the buyer is responsible for
the whole shipment from door to door. All costs and liabilities
are with the buyer. The only responsibility for a seller during
the whole transportation process is to ensure that the goods they
are selling are made available for collection at their premises.
