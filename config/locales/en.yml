        <p>
          Quotas allow a limited amount of goods to be imported at a lower duty
          rate. Once the quota has been used up, you will revert to the out-of-quota
          rate, which may be the third-country duty or a preferential rate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Quotas can be non-preferential (open to many countries) or preferential
          (restricted to a particular trading partner).

        <p>
          Due to the ongoing situation in Ukraine, we recognise that some Ukrainian exporters,
          who do not hold Approved Exporter status and rely on EUR1 certificates to evidence the preferential origin of their goods,
          may not be able to obtain the duly endorsed certificates. In these cases,
          HMRC has introduced an easement enabling preference to be claimed by UK importers
          based on an unendorsed EUR1 certificate supported/or by alternative evidence that corroborates the originating status of the goods.
        </p>
        <p>
          To claim preference under this easement UK importers must enter code '9UKR' in Box 44 of the customs declaration.

            produced in a country covered in a trade agreement, without
            incorporating materials from any other country.

            countries** that are sufficiently worked or processed according to
            the rules laid out in the %{scheme_title}

            **Product-specific rules** define how a product needs to be
            processed to be considered as originating in %{trade_country_name}
            and therefore eligible for preferential tariff treatment.

            If there are multiple rules, your product needs only comply with one
            of them.
          details:
            summary: What kind of product-specific rules are there?
            content_md: |
              Broadly speaking, there are four types of rule that determine if
              your product has been sufficiently transformed to be considered as
              originating.

              - **The 'value added' rule**
                The value of all non-originating materials used cannot exceed a
                given percentage of the product’s ex-works price.
              - **Change of tariff classification**
                The production process results in a change of tariff
                classification between the non-originating materials and the
                final product.
              - **Manufacture from certain products**
                A specific production process is required. For example, spinning
                fibres into yarns. Such rules are mostly used in the textile and
                clothing and chemical sectors.
              - **Specific processes**
                A specific production process is required. For example, spinning
                fibres into yarns.

          body_md: |
            You will also be required to demonstrate that the work carried out
            on non-originating components goes beyond the **minimal operations**
            requirements defined in the %{scheme_title}.

            If the production performed in your country is one of those listed
            and nothing else was made there, meaning no material was produced or
            transformed, the product cannot be considered as originating, even
            if the product-specific rules of origin were satisfied.
        parts:
          title: Including parts or components from other countries
          body_md: |
            You may also be able to include non-originating materials imported
            from third countries or processing carried out in a non-partner
            country, as originating in the EU or a trade partner country,
            according to the **cumulation rules** of the %{scheme_title}.

        body_md: |
          In order to qualify for preferential treatment, you may be able to
          include parts that come from other countries. This depends on the
          **cumulation rules** of the trade agreement, which are described
          below.

          **Cumulation** may allow for the origin of materials or processing
          undertaken in country A to be added to the materials and processing
          undertaken within country B, so long as they are further processed
          or added to products originating in country B.

          This allows those factors that contributed to the origin of country
          A materials to be considered as though undertaken in B.
        cumulation:

          body_md: |
            **Bilateral cumulation**

            Bilateral cumulation operates between 2 countries or trading blocs
            where a trade agreement contains a provision allowing them to
            cumulate origin.

            Materials originating in either country in the trade agreement will
            be considered as materials covered by the rule of origin.

            **Example of bilateral cumulation**

            Take a car, for example. If a UK company sourced all of the parts
            from across the EU and then put it all together in a factory in the
            UK, it could sell it back to a customer in the EU, taking advantage
            of the preferential zero tariff rate, as if all the bits of the car
            originated in the UK.

          In order to qualify for preferential treatment, non-originating parts
          must be sufficiently processed to count as originating.

          Manufacturing and processing operations must be more than simple
          operations or processes, and must need special skills, machines,
          apparatus or equipment especially produced or installed to carry out
          the manufacture or process.

          Some operations are regarded as too minor to confer originating status
          to non-originating materials that are used in the production of your
          goods. These operations are referred to as 'insufficient processing'
          and are specific to each trade agreement.
        operations:
          summary: What are simple operations?
          content: |
            Some of the listed operations can be clearly identified as
            insufficient operations, such as the affixing of a label on the
            product. However, there are also some operations that need to be
            assessed further as they contain the term ‘simple’, for example
            ‘simple assembly’.

            ‘Simple’ usually describes activities which do not need special
            skills, machines, apparatus, or equipment especially produced or
            installed for carrying out the activity. This term may be further
            defined so that the skills, machines, apparatus, or tools used must
            also contribute to the product’s essential characteristics or
            properties.
