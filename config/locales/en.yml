        <p>
          Quotas allow a limited amount of goods to be imported at a lower duty
          rate. Once the quota has been used up, you will revert to the out-of-quota
          rate, which may be the third-country duty or a preferential rate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Quotas can be non-preferential (open to many countries) or preferential
          (restricted to a particular trading partner).

        <p>
          Due to the ongoing situation in Ukraine, we recognise that some Ukrainian exporters,
          who do not hold Approved Exporter status and rely on EUR1 certificates to evidence the preferential origin of their goods,
          may not be able to obtain the duly endorsed certificates. In these cases,
          HMRC has introduced an easement enabling preference to be claimed by UK importers
          based on an unendorsed EUR1 certificate supported/or by alternative evidence that corroborates the originating status of the goods.
        </p>
        <p>
          To claim preference under this easement UK importers must enter code '9UKR' in Box 44 of the customs declaration.

          This page defines the broad rules that determine if your product
          originates in %{originating_country} according to the %{scheme_title}
          and therefore eligible for preferential tariff treatment.
        conditions_md: |
          The following products are considered as originating in Japan:

          * products **wholly obtained** in %{originating_country}

            Your goods are treated as 'wholly obtained' if they’re exclusively
            produced in a country covered in a trade agreement, without
            incorporating materials from any other country.

          * Products that incorporate **materials originating from different
            countries** that are sufficiently worked or processed according to
            the rules laid out in the %{scheme_title}

          These concepts are defined throughout the next pages, so that you can
          determine if your product meets the rules of origin.
