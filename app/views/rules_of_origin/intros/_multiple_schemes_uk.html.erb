  <p>
   Your trade may qualify for preferential tariff treatment. This means you may be eligible to pay lower or zero duties.
  </p>

   <p>
   To qualify for preferential tariff treatment, you must meet the product-specific rules of origin under the following agreements:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <% schemes.each do |scheme| %>
      <li><%= scheme.title %></li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>

   <p>
    Note, you do not need to apply for a preferential tariff (or comply with preferential rules of origin) if the MFN duty for your product is zero.
  </p>
